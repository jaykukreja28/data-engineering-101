🎬 Data Engineering 101: Movie Pipeline for Beginners
Welcome to Data Engineering 101, a beginner-friendly project that walks you through the fundamentals of building a basic data pipeline — using a classic dataset of top-rated movies! 🍿

This project is ideal if you're just stepping into the world of data engineering and want to understand:

How to load data

Perform type conversions

Enrich data with derived fields

Analyze and persist your results

📂 Project Overview
This pipeline is built with pure Python, no external libraries needed beyond the standard library. It's clean, readable, and perfect for learning how real-world pipelines work.

💡 What it Does:
Loads movie data from a CSV

Converts data types (like strings to dates and floats)

Enriches the data with new fields (e.g., decade, category)

Analyzes it (top movies, average ratings)

Saves the enriched data to JSON
